# HELLO MUSIC VISUALIZER 
A simple app to visualize audio signal in real time. 

This example analyzes the soundwave using the **p5.js sound** library, and renders the graphics using **shaders** wrapped under **p5.js**. In this example, the waveform is passed as a `sampler2D` uniform to the shader.

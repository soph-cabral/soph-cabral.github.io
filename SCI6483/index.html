            <p>I'm a computational design researcher and educator passionate about creating technology that bridges the gap between humans and nature. Growing up in Bel√©m, on the edge of the Amazon in northern Brazil, I developed a deep connection with natural systems that continues to influence my work.
                My research focuses on developing computer vision and sensing technologies for the built environment, with special interest in urban habitats that can foster diverse ecological interactions. I believe cities should be places where all species can thrive together, effectively blurring the boundaries between nature and the cityscape.
                At Harvard, I work on multi-modal sensing approaches and robotic applications, while previously I've founded a design studio and worked for companies as an industry researcher such as Autodesk and ArquitectonicaGEO. Whether teaching, designing, or coding, my goal remains the same: to create technologies and spaces that make our world more inclusive for all forms of life. </p>
